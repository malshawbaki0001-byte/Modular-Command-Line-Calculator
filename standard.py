# this mode is the task of the monla brothers omer and mohammed
''' 1. Standard Mode (standard.py) 
This mode handles basic arithmetic operations, similar to a simple calculator. 
• Features:  
o Support for addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), modulo (%), 
and exponentiation (**). 
o Additional functions: square root (sqrt), reciprocal (1/x), percentage (% of a 
number). 
o Allow chained operations or simple expression evaluation (e.g., evaluate "2 + 3 * 
4" using Python's eval() with safeguards, or implement a basic parser). 
• Input/Output:  
o Interactive: Prompt for operation (e.g., "Enter operation: add") and operands (e.g., 
"Enter first number: 5", "Enter second number: 3"). 
o Or command-based: Accept a full expression as input. 
• Validation/Error Handling:  
o Check for valid operators and numeric inputs. 
o Handle division by zero: "Error: Cannot divide by zero." 
o For sqrt, ensure non-negative input: "Error: Square root of negative number not 
supported in standard mode." 
• Example Usage:  
Standard Mode 
Enter expression (e.g., 5 + 3): 5 / 0 
Error: Cannot divide by zero. '''
